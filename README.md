3. **Final Approver**: Specific user (e.g., CFO) has final approval authority
4. **Manager Hierarchy**: Automatic routing based on organizational structure

### Example Workflow
```javascript
{
  "name": "Standard Approval",
  "steps": [
    { "stepNumber": 1, "approver": "manager_id" },
    { "stepNumber": 2, "approver": "finance_manager_id" }
  ],
  "rules": {
    "percentageApproval": 60,
    "finalApprover": "cfo_id"
  }
}
```

## Development Guidelines
